GitLab Notes
1. Introduction to GitLab
GitLab is a web-based DevOps lifecycle tool that provides a Git repository manager with CI/CD, issue tracking, and more.

2. Key Features
Git Repository Management – Similar to GitHub but self-hosted or cloud-based.

CI/CD Pipelines – Automate build, test, and deploy.

Issue Tracking – Manage projects and track bugs.

Merge Requests (MRs) – Code review process.

Access Control – Manage user permissions.

3. GitLab Workflow
Clone Repository

sh
Copy
Edit
git clone <repo-url>
cd <repo-name>
Create a Branch

sh
Copy
Edit
git checkout -b feature-branch
Make Changes & Commit

sh
Copy
Edit
git add .
git commit -m "Added new feature"
Push to Remote Repository

sh
Copy
Edit
git push origin feature-branch
Create a Merge Request (MR)

Go to GitLab → Merge Requests → New Merge Request

Select source branch (feature-branch) and target branch (main)

Click Create Merge Request

Code Review & Merge

Reviewer checks code

Merge changes after approval

4. GitLab CI/CD Basics
GitLab CI/CD automates testing and deployment using a .gitlab-ci.yml file.

Example .gitlab-ci.yml
yaml
Copy
Edit
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

build-job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "Building the project..."

test-job:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "Running tests..."

deploy-job:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Deploying..."
  only:
    - main
stages: Defines pipeline steps.

script: Commands to run in each stage.

only: Runs on the main branch only.

5. GitLab Runner
A GitLab Runner executes CI/CD pipelines.

Install Runner:

sh
Copy
Edit
sudo gitlab-runner register
Start Runner:

sh
Copy
Edit
sudo gitlab-runner start
6. GitLab Issues & Milestones
Issues → Track bugs/features.

Milestones → Group issues for releases.

Boards → Kanban-style project management.

7. GitLab Permissions
Role	Access Level
Guest	Read-only
Reporter	View issues
Developer	Push code
Maintainer	Merge code
Owner	Full control
8. Self-Hosting GitLab
Install GitLab on a server:

sh
Copy
Edit
sudo apt update && sudo apt install gitlab-ce
Access Web UI via http://your-server-ip

Configure settings in /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb

9. GitLab Webhooks & Integrations
Webhooks – Automate tasks by triggering external services.

Integrations – Connect with Jira, Slack, Kubernetes, etc.
